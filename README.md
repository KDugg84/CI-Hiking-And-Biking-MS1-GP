<h1>Hiking & Biking</h1>

Hiking & Biking is a website designed to be informative and is aimed primarily at tourists who are keen on exploring new and interesting hiking and biking trails. The site will consist of three pages and will focus on the Ribeira Sacra region in southern Lugo province in the autonomous region of Galicia in northwestern Spain. 

The Ribeira Sacra offers stunning landscapes, panoramic mountain ranges and large flowing rivers ideal for any type of outdoor enthusiast, but in this case focusing on hikers and cross country bikers. The site is designed to be responsive across all devices making it easy for people to access not just via desktops/laptops but also on tablets and mobile devices.

The site has the protenial to expand it's information base in the future to include other areas of Spain and Europe as a whole. As a business idea, the site can add to the Ribeira Sacra's growing tourist industry and reputation as an area of outstanding natural beauty and is currently shortlisted to be recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Viability/Feasability formula; take the average viability x the number of items.

Reasons for choosing the above opportunities.

* Online presence 

    * This is of course manadatory and more than feasible given what I have learnt on the course up-to-now.

    <br>

* Structured layout

    * This is again an important/mandatory area and well within my skill set, the Information Architecture of the site 
      needs to be intuitive meaning that you can easily learn how to use the site from it's layout. 

      <br>

* Location details
    
    * This can be achieved throught the use of text and images relating to the specific regions that are covered within the activities page.

    <br>

* Social media interaction

    * Again this is well within my skill set and can be as simple as the use of icons neseted within the site's footer.

    <br>

* Email news-letter 

    * Whilst I have the skills to create a signup/contact form, a database of customer emails would be required to handle this particular feature and that is something at the moment is not within my skills set given the allotted time frame. 

<h2>Design</h2>

<h3>Colour Scheme</h3>
<br>

Because the site is focused on outdoor activities it felt appropriate to use colours that would help create and enforce the sense of being in the outdoors and with nature.

The two main colours used throughout the site are forestgreen (#228b22) used for the logo and borders for the imagery and lightgreen (#90ee90) for the footer.

<h3>Typography</h3>
<br>

There are two fonts that were imported in the project used throughout the site, Oswald (weight: 600) used to create the logo and Lato (weight: 300) used as the body text. The backup font used in the font-family is Sans-Serif incase the imported fonts fail to load. 

Because the site would have a white background for the majority of each page it felt necessary to avoid using black for the text instead using a shade of gray (#77777) to create a subtle contrast between the text and the background.

<h3>Imagery</h3>
<br>

Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also imploys the use of animations designed to make the image "pop" just a bit more.

The hero image came from a Google images search on the Ribeira Sacra [Click the link to view](https://aviturga.es/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/mirador-de-vilouxe.jpeg)

The two centre images used in the home page came from a related Google images search on hiking and cross county biking in Galicia:

* [The two hikers](https://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/destinations/europe/105683889/galicia-spain-hiking-the-last-unspoilt-coast-of-europe)

* [The mountain biker](https://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/ourense/manzaneda/2023/04/07/manzaneda-bike-park-estacion-funciona-nueve-pistas/0003_202304O7C4994.htm)

The photos of the two Twitter users commenting on the site came from Code Institute's Whiskey Drop walkthrough exercise [Click to view the page](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/BootstrappingYourNextBigIdea-BS4) 

The imagery used throughout the activities page came primarily from the Ribeira Sacra's own guide to hiking and biking
[Visit the official website](https://turismo.ribeirasacra.org/es/descarga-de-guias-y-mapas)

The Hero image was re-used as the background to the contact-us page as its such a striking photo helping to reinforce the beauty of the Ribeira Sacra.
