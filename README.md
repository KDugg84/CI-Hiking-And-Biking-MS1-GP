Hiking & Biking is a website designed to be informative and is aimed primarily at tourists who are keen on exploring new and interesting hiking and biking trails. The site will consist of three pages and will focus on the Ribeira Sacra region in southern Lugo province in the autonomous region of Galicia in northwestern Spain. 

The Ribeira Sacra offers stunning landscapes, panoramic mountain ranges and large flowing rivers ideal for any type of outdoor enthusiast, but in this case focusing on hikers and cross country bikers. The site is designed to be responsive across all devices making it easy for people to access not just via desktops/laptops but also on tablets and mobile devices.

The site has the protenial to expand it's information base in the future to include other areas of Spain and Europe as a whole. As a business idea, the site can add to the Ribeira Sacra's growing tourist industry and reputation as an area of outstanding natural beauty and is currently shortlisted to be recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
