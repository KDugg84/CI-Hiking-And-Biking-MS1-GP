<h1>Hiking & Biking</h1>

Hiking & Biking is a website designed to be informative and is aimed primarily at tourists who are keen on exploring new and interesting hiking and biking trails. The site will consist of three pages and will focus on the Ribeira Sacra region in southern Lugo province in the autonomous region of Galicia in northwestern Spain. 

The Ribeira Sacra offers stunning landscapes, panoramic mountain ranges and large flowing rivers ideal for any type of outdoor enthusiast, but in this case focusing on hikers and cross country bikers. The site is designed to be responsive across all devices making it easy for people to access not just via desktops/laptops but also on tablets and mobile devices.

The site has the protenial to expand it's information base in the future to include other areas of Spain and Europe as a whole. As a business idea, the site can add to the Ribeira Sacra's growing tourist industry and reputation as an area of outstanding natural beauty and is currently shortlisted to be recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Viability/Feasibility formula; take the average viability x the number of items.

Reasons for choosing the above opportunities.

* Online presence


    * This is of course manadatory and more than feasible given what I have learnt on the course up-to-now.


* Structured layout

    * This is again an important/mandatory area and well within my skill set, the Information Architecture of the site 
      needs to be intuitive meaning that you can easily learn how to use the site from it's layout. 


* Location details
    
    * This can be achieved throught the use of text and images relating to the specific regions that are covered within the activities page.


* Social media interaction

    * Again this is well within my skill set and can be as simple as the use of icons nested within the site's footer.


* Email news letter 

    * Whilst I have the skills to create a signup/contact form, a database of customer details would be required to handle this particular feature and that is something at the moment is not within my skills set given the allotted time frame. 

<h2>Design</h2>

<h3>Colour Scheme</h3>

Because the site is focused on outdoor activities it felt appropriate to use colours that would help create and enforce the sense of being in the outdoors and with nature.

The two main colours used throughout the site are forestgreen (#228b22) used for the logo and borders for the imagery and lightgreen (#90ee90) for the footer.

<h3>Typography</h3>

There are two fonts that were imported into the project used throughout the site, Oswald (weight: 600) was used to create the logo and Lato (weight: 300) was used as the body text. The backup font used in the font-family is Sans-Serif incase the imported fonts fail to load. 

Because the site would have a white background for the majority of each page it felt necessary to avoid using black for the text instead using a shade of gray (#77777) to create a subtle contrast between the text and the background.

<h3>Imagery</h3>

Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also imploys the use of animations designed to make the image "pop" just a bit more.

The hero image came from a Google images search on the Ribeira Sacra [Click the link to view](https://aviturga.es/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/mirador-de-vilouxe.jpeg)

The two center images used in the home page came from a related Google images search on hiking and cross county biking in Galicia:

* [The two hikers](https://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/destinations/europe/105683889/galicia-spain-hiking-the-last-unspoilt-coast-of-europe)

* [The mountain biker](https://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/ourense/manzaneda/2023/04/07/manzaneda-bike-park-estacion-funciona-nueve-pistas/0003_202304O7C4994.htm)

The photos of the two Twitter users commenting on the site came from Code Institute's Whiskey Drop walkthrough exercise [Click the link to view](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/BootstrappingYourNextBigIdea-BS4) 

The imagery used throughout the activities page came primarily from the Ribeira Sacra's own guide to hiking and long distance mountain biking.

The Hero image was re-used as the background for the contact-us page as its such a striking photo helping to reinforce the beauty of the Ribeira Sacra.

<h3>Wireframes</h3>

The wireframes were created using Balsamiq desktop for Windows 10

* [Activities Page](assets/img/readme/wireframes/Activities.png)

* [Contact Us Page](assets/img/readme/wireframes/Contact.png) 

<h3>Features</h3>

Hiking & Biking consists of three pages (Home, Activities and Contact Us).

* Features that are common across the site include:

    * The logo acts as a link back to the home page regardless of which page the user is currently viewing.

    * A responsive navigation bar across the top of all three pages that adapts to being viewed on different screen sizes, below 768px the navigation anchor/list elements change to a dropdown hamburger icon for a more mobile friendly experience, the same happens when viewed on tablets.

    * Home - navigates to the home page.

    * Activities - navigates to the activities page..

    * Contact Us - navigates to the contact form page.

    * The footer houses the site's social media links represented by Font Awesome icons, when clicked will open (in a new tab) that social media's home page.

* Home Page: 

    * A hero image taken from the Mirador de Vilouxe, a striking image which helps to give the user a sense of how spectacular the landscape of the Ribeira Sacra is.

    * A brief overview of the Ribeira Sacra broken into two sections covering both hiking and mountain biking in the region.  

    * A comments section below the overview with quotes from two users expressing their thoughts on the site via Twitter.  

* Activities Page:

    * An introduction on how to use the hiking guide along with a disclaimer reminding users of the risks involved in both sports. 

    * Each route detailed is accompanied by directions on how to get to each route from a start point, statistics on each route along with an image taken from that particular area. 

    * Each hiking route description also makes reference to whether it is suitable to bike the route as well.

    * A separate section on long distance mountain biking trails which follows the same layout as the hiking section to maintain the look of the page. 

* Contact Us Page:

    * Contains a contact form which can be used to recieve more information, the form includes radio buttons where users can rate their overall user experience along with a comments section where they can elaborate more. As part of form validation the name and email fields have been set to required, this prompts the user to enter details if they have been missed. The form can be submitted using the submit button which POSTS to https://formdump.codeinstitute.net and returns the values entered.

<h3>Future Implementations</h3>

* A database for storing user's information as the basis for a news letter or info pack which can be sent out to subscribers informing them of changes or updates being made to the site. 

<h3>Accessibility</h3>

Whilst coding the site I have ensured that the site is accesible for all. This is achieve by using:

* Google Dev Tools to check contrast of items.
* Alt tags to describe the images on site.
* Semantic HTML

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<h3>Languages Used</h3>

* HTML5 and CSS3
* JavaScript - the Hamburger Dropdown menu from Bootstrap 5.3

<h3>Software, Frameworks & Libraries Used</h3>

* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) was used to create the wireframes for the website.
* [Bootstrap 5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/) was only used to create the navigation bar taking advantage of it's built in responsive classes. The boilerplate was modified slightly to include a few custom CSS styles such as letter spacing and a bottom-border to help remind users of what page they are viewing.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) was used extensively throughout the project, the mountain icon was used to develop to logo, the hiker and biker icons were used in both the home and activities pages along with maps and a warning icon at the top of the activities page. 
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the Oswald font for the logo and Lato for the body text.
* Google Dev Tools was used to identify and resolve problems related to responsiveness and appearance.
* [Github](https://github.com/) was used to store my project in a repository.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used for version control.
* [Google](https://google.com) was used to research HTML & CSS.
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) the vast majority of my time was spent inside GitPod's VSCode Cloud IDE.
* CDNs [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/what-is-cloudflare/) and [JsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) were used for Font Awesome icons CSS minified and Bootstrap 5.3 minified.
* Free [Online Image Editor](https://www.online-image-editor.com/) was used to crop and resize some of the images used in the project.
